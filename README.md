# Multi-Domain Turbine-Generator Component Models for Sub-Synchronous Oscillation Studies in Modelica
 This repository contains Modelica models presented at the 15th International Modelica Conference for the following paper:

 > Eric Segerstrom, Luigi Vanfretti, Chetan Mishra and Kevin D. Jones, "Modeling Components of a Turbine-Generator System for Sub-Synchronous Oscillation Studies with Modelica", Proceedings of the 15th International Modelica Conference, Aachen, Germany, Oct. 9-11, 2023.

 These models include a scalable torsional shaft model (SHAF25), a round-rotor generator model with a DC offset torque component (GENDCO), and a Single Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB) test system to perform preliminary evaluation of these models.
 
# Dependencies
  The models presented in this repostiory are dependent on the [OpenIPSL Library v3.0.0](https://github.com/OpenIPSL/OpenIPSL/releases/tag/v3.0.0).
